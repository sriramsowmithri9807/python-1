Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Python Project! This simple console-based game allows you to play the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game against a friend or against the computer.

Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a two-player game where the objective is to get three of your symbols (either X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal. This project serves as a fun way to learn and practice Python programming.
