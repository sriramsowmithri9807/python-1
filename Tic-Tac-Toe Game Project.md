Tic-Tac-Toe Game Project

Project Description:
--------------------
The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a classic two-player board game in which players take turns to mark 'X' or 'O' on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to have three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. This Python project aims to implement a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Project Structure:
-------------------
1. `main.py` - The main entry point of the game.
2. `board.py` - Contains the Board class for managing the game board.
3. `player.py` - Defines the Player class to manage player moves and information.
4. `game.py` - Manages the game flow, logic, and checks for a win or a draw.
5. `utils.py` - Utility functions for input validation and display.
6. `README.txt` - Project documentation and instructions.

Features:
---------
1. A 3x3 grid is displayed in the console for the game board.
2. Two players can take turns to enter their 'X' or 'O' on the board.
3. The game checks for a win condition by three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
4. The game checks for a draw if the board is filled without a win.
5. Players can choose to replay the game after it ends.
6. Input validation ensures only valid moves are accepted.

How to Play:
------------
1. Run `main.py` to start the game.
2. Players take turns entering row and column numbers (e.g., "1 2" to place 'X' or 'O' in the first row, second column).
3. The game displays the updated board and checks for a win or draw.
4. The game ends when there is a winner or a draw.
5. Players can choose to replay.

Usage:
------
$ python main.py
